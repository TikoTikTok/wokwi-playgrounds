# Potentiometer Playground

The potentiometer is connected to Analog pin **`A0`**, and the LED
to pin **`11`**. Rotating the potentiometer will change the blink
rate of the LED:

<wokwi-potentiometer pin="A0" value="511"></wokwi-potentiometer>
<wokwi-led label="11" color="red"></wokwi-led>

Can you make the potentiometer control the brightness of the LED instead?
