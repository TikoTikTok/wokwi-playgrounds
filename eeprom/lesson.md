# EEPROM Playground

Run the simulation by clicking on <strong>Run Code</strong>, then interact with the program in the virtual Serial Monitor.

The program counts how many times you pressed the green button, and also the total time the button was pressed. It stores this data in the Arduino's <strong>EEPROM</strong>, so the information is kept even if you refresh this page.
